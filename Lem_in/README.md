# -Lem_in-projects-  
(Elementary algorithmic project)

Program receive the data describing the ant farm from the standard output in the following format:
  - number_of_ants (number)
  - the_rooms (the rooms, are defined by: name coord_x coord_y)
  - the_links (the links, are defined by: name1-name2)

 The goal of this project is to find the quickest ways to get n ants across the farm.
 
 Result display on the standard output in the following format:
  - number_of_ants
  - the_rooms
  - the_links
  
  - Lx-y Lz-w Lr-o ... (x, z, r represents the ants’ numbers (going from 1 to number_of_ants) and y,
                        w, o represents the rooms’ names.)
